## Description
A simple game of Tic Tac Toe, a game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.

Done with HTML and CSS for the visual part and Vanilla JavaScript for the logic.
